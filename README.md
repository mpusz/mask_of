# `mask_of<Enum>`

`mask_of<Enum>` is a template type to express bitmasks created from scoped enumeration type values.

I use similar type in production for some time already. Making that code Open Source was inspired by the
article
[Using Enum Classes as Bitfields](https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/cplusplus/using-enum-classes-as-bitfields.html)
by Anthony Williams. He also encouraged me to share it and write somewhere about it. Thanks Anthony!
